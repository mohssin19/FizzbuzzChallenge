# FizzbuzzChallenge
Fizzbuzz challenge using TDD and Reflection

## Unit Tests
you can run the unit tests by building the whole project in visual studio, then opening your test explorer in you view option in the toolbar if you don't see it on your screen.

## Thought Process
My thought process behind this code was keeping it as simple as possible by utilising a service. 
Going through each failing test to get basic code written for the logic.
To then display how it could be refactored but keeping core basic code then validating inputs using reflection.
